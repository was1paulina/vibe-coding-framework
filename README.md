### VIBE CODING FRAMEWORK ###

> **My attempt to systematize everything I've learned about building prototypes with AI**

A comprehensive guide documenting my learnings and approach to turning ideas into working prototypes using Claude, compiled for anyone who wants to learn vibe coding.

**Version 1.0** - October 2025

---

## 📝 What This Is

This is my personal compilation of everything I've learned about "vibe coding" - building software prototypes through conversation with AI (specifically Claude). 

After building multiple projects and learning through trial and error, I've:
- Systematized my approach into a repeatable framework
- Documented common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Created two versions: a comprehensive guide and a streamlined version (coming soon)
- Organized all the prompts, patterns, and techniques that actually work

## 🎯 What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe Coding is building software through conversation with AI. Instead of writing code yourself, you describe what you want in plain language, see what the AI builds, and iterate until it works.

**Think of it like working with a really fast junior developer who:**
- ✅ Understands natural language
- ✅ Builds things instantly
- ✅ Never gets tired of changes
- ❌ Needs clear instructions
- ❌ Sometimes misunderstands what you want
- ❌ Can't make product decisions for you

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Read Part 1** of the guide (15 min) - Understand what vibe coding is
2. **Choose a simple first project** (Something you can build in 2-4 hours)
3. **Follow Phase 1-2** (Planning - 30-60 min)
4. **Start building with Claude** (Phase 3)

**Never done this before?** Start with the complete walkthrough in Part 4 to see a real example from start to finish.

## 📚 What's Inside

### [Part 1: Understanding Vibe Coding](vibe_coding_framework_v1_updated.md#part-1-understanding-vibe-coding)
- What is vibe coding and who it's for
- When to use (and not use) it
- How this framework works

### [Part 2: Getting Ready](vibe_coding_framework_v1_updated.md#part-2-getting-ready)
- Pre-flight checklist
- Setting up your workspace
- The vibe coding mindset

### [Part 3: The Framework](vibe_coding_framework_v1_updated.md#part-3-the-framework)

**Phase 1: Think Before You Build** (30-60 min)
- Define the problem
- Pressure-test with AI
- Choose your target (POC/MVP/Demo/Internal Tool)

**Phase 2: Plan Your Build** (30-60 min)
- Describe what you want
- Break down features
- Prepare your first prompt

**Phase 3: Build with Claude** (2-8 hours)
- Start the conversation
- Build-test-iterate loop
- Quality checkpoints

**Phase 4: Validate** (2-4 hours)
- Test with real users
- Analyze feedback
- Polish or pivot

**Phase 5: Share & Decide** (1-2 hours)
- Deploy your prototype
- Plan what's next

### [Part 4: Complete Walkthrough](vibe_coding_framework_v1_updated.md#part-4-complete-walkthrough)
Real case study: Building a customer feedback tool from scratch

### [Part 5: Resources](vibe_coding_framework_v1_updated.md#part-5-resources)
- **Prompt Library** - Copy-paste templates
- **Common Scenarios** - Forms, dashboards, calculators, etc.
- **Troubleshooting Guide** - Solutions to common problems
- **Glossary** - Technical terms explained simply

---

## 💡 What Can You Build?

### ✅ Perfect For:
- **Quick Prototypes** - Test ideas before investing engineering time
- **Internal Tools** - Sales trackers, content calendars, calculators
- **Demos & Presentations** - Stakeholder pitches and investor demos
- **MVPs for Validation** - Test with 5-10 users before full development

### ❌ Not Suitable For:
- Production customer-facing applications (without engineering review)
- Apps handling payments or sensitive data
- Systems requiring 24/7 uptime
- HIPAA/SOC2/GDPR-regulated applications
- Complex integrations with existing systems

---

## 🛠️ What You Need

### You DON'T Need:
- ❌ Coding experience
- ❌ Technical background
- ❌ Computer science degree

### You DO Need:
- ✅ Clear idea of what problem you're solving
- ✅ Ability to describe what you want
- ✅ Patience to iterate
- ✅ Claude.ai account (Free or Pro)

## 📖 How to Use This Guide

This guide is structured in 5 phases that take you from idea to deployed prototype:

1. **Read Part 1-2 first** (15 minutes) - Foundation
2. **Follow the framework step-by-step** - Don't skip planning phases
3. **Use Part 4 (walkthrough)** when you get stuck
4. **Reference Part 5 (prompt library)** for templates

**My experience:**
- First project: ~10 hours (lots of trial and error)
- After learning these patterns: 3-5 hours per project
- Simple tools: Sometimes just 2 hours

## 💭 Why I Created This

After building several prototypes with Claude, I noticed I was repeating the same patterns, making the same mistakes, and solving the same problems over and over. 

This guide is my attempt to:
- Systematize what works (so I don't have to remember it all)
- Document common pitfalls (so I stop hitting them)
- Create reusable prompts (so I'm not starting from scratch each time)
- Share what I've learned (maybe it helps someone else)

**This is a living document** - I'll update it as I learn more.

## 🤝 Feedback & Suggestions

This is a personal project, but I welcome feedback:

- **Found something confusing?** Open an issue
- **Have a suggestion?** Open an issue or PR
- **Built something using this?** I'd love to hear about it

I'm still learning and improving this framework, so your input helps make it better.
